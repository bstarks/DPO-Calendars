## Road Map

 - Re-factor code: The code was cobbled together quickly and sloppily some years ago. It needs to be updated to ES6/7 and constructed a bit more skillfully/efficiently.
 - Make month view: A view for insertion into planners or for individual preference.
 - Fix options pane
 - Make web component version.
